(1, 'Apple fruit and tree', 'Apple, (Malus domestica), domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though apples are also used commercially for vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce, and apple butter and are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of the global crop also is used for cider, wine, and brandy. Fresh apples are eaten raw or cooked. There are a variety of ways in which cooked apples are used; frequently, they are used as a pastry filling, apple pie being perhaps the archetypal American dessert. Especially in Europe, fried apples characteristically accompany certain dishes of sausage or pork. Apples provide vitamins A and C, are high in carbohydrates, and are an excellent source of dietary fibre.\r\nApple trees are generally small trees, and a given variety can be grafted onto dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks for smaller and less vigorous plants. If left untrimmed, a tree grown with standard (seedling) rootstock will often reach a height of 9 metres (30 feet) with an equally large crown diametre. The bark is usually brown and scaly. The simple leaves are roughly oval in shape and usually have fine teeth along the margins. Apple flowers are showy with five white petals, often tinged with pink, and numerous stamens. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and most varieties require cross-pollination for fertilization.\r\n', '1679739241blog13.jpg', '2023-03-25 10:14:02', 2, 1, 0),
(2, 'Vegetables are good sources of minerals, especially calcium and iron, and vitamins, principally A and C.', 'vegetable, in the broadest sense, any kind of plant life or plant product, namely &ldquo;vegetable matter&rdquo;; in common, narrow usage, the term vegetable usually refers to the fresh edible portions of certain herbaceous plants&mdash;roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruit, or seeds. These plant parts are either eaten fresh or prepared in a number of ways, usually as a savory, rather than sweet, dish.\r\n\r\nA brief treatment of vegetables and vegetable farming follows. For in-depth treatment of vegetable cultivation, see vegetable farming. For treatment of the nutrient composition and processing of vegetables, see vegetable processing.\r\n\r\nVirtually all of the more important vegetables were cultivated among the ancient civilizations of either the Old or the New World and have long been noted for their nutritional importance. Most fresh vegetables are low in calories and have a water content in excess of 70 percent, with only about 3.5 percent protein and less than 1 percent fat. Vegetables are good sources of minerals, especially calcium and iron, and vitamins, principally A and C. Nearly all vegetables are rich in dietary fibre and antioxidants.\r\n\r\nVegetables are usually classified on the basis of the part of the plant that is used for food. The root vegetables include beets, carrots, radishes, sweet potatoes, and turnips. Stem vegetables include asparagus and kohlrabi. Among the edible tubers, or underground stems, are potatoes. The leaf and leafstalk vegetables include brussels sprouts, cabbage, celery, lettuce, rhubarb, and spinach. Among the bulb vegetables are garlic, leeks, and onions. The head, or flower, vegetables include artichokes, broccoli, and cauliflower. The fruits commonly considered vegetables by virtue of their use include cucumbers, eggplant, okra, sweet corn, squash, peppers, and tomatoes. Seed vegetables are usually legumes, such as peas and beans.', '1679739672blog25.jpg', '2023-03-25 10:21:12', 3, 1, 0),
(4, 'When you think of a robot, what do you see? A machine that looks a bit like you and me? ', 'When you think of a robot, what do you see? A machine that looks a bit like you and me? The reality is that robots can come in many different shapes and sizes. They don&rsquo;t need to look like humans&mdash;in fact, most don&rsquo;t. What a robot looks like depends on its purpose. Flying robots might look like helicopters, or have wings like insects or birds. Cleaning robots often look like little vacuums. Robots that are meant to interact with people often have a face, eyes, or a mouth&mdash;just like we do! Whether they look like us or not, most robots have three essential ingredients that make them a robot: sensors, actuators, and programs. Together, these ingredients are what make a robot different from other electronics and gadgets you might have around your house, like your computer, your washing machine, or your toaster. Sensors, Actuators, and Programs First, a robot has sensors that allow it to perceive the world. Just like we have eyes to sense light, ears to sense sound, and nerves in our skin that sense if something is touching us, robots have light sensors and cameras so they can &ldquo;see,&rdquo; microphones so they can &ldquo;hear,&rdquo; and pressure sensors so they can &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the things around them. The kinds of sensors that a robot needs depends on what the robot was made for. A robot vacuum cleaner might use a bumper with pressure sensors to understand where a wall is. A flying robot uses a group of sensors called an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to help it stay balanced when it flies. Some of the sensors used by robots are very different from the kinds of sensors used by people. Second, a robot has actuators that allow it to move around. We might use our legs and feet to walk and run, and we might use our hands to pick up an orange and peel it. A robot might use actuators such as motors and wheels to drive places, and finger-like grippers to grab objects and manipulate them or turn them around. Third, a robot needs a program that lets it act on its own based on what it is sensing. This ability to act on one&rsquo;s own is called autonomy. Let&rsquo;s look at this idea of autonomy more closely. Autonomy Can you think of anything that has autonomy? People have autonomy, because they can decide for themselves how to behave or move&mdash;at least most of the time! Your toaster, your washing machine, or a remote-controlled toy are examples of machines that don&rsquo;t have autonomy, because they depend on a person to make decisions for them. When a robot is autonomous, it&rsquo;s not quite the same as a person being autonomous, because a person still has to write the computer program that tells the robot what to do. For example, when we listen to music, our brains are in charge of telling us how to move our own legs to the beat&mdash;we don&rsquo;t need someone to move our legs for us! But what if we want to build a robot that can autonomously dance to a beat? What three basic things would we need?1. Sensor. We would need a microphone (sound sensor) so that the robot could hear the music.2. Actuators. We would need some actuators (like motors with wheels) so that the robot could move.3. Program. We would need to write a program that says to the robot: &ldquo;When you hear the music beat, move this way.&rdquo; We would also need a computer&mdash;the robot&rsquo;s brain&mdash;that could process all the sensory information and run the program, and some kind of power supply (like a battery) to provide electricity to our robot.

(5, 'The Encyclopedia of Indian Art, arriving online next month, aims to be comprehensive and yet accessible to experts and students of all kinds.', 'The history of art in India, going back 10,000 years to the Bhimbetka cave drawings, has long been told through a Western lens or written by Indian scholars in a dense, academic style that felt inaccessible to many.\r\n\r\nBut that will soon change, when the MAP Academy Encyclopedia of Indian Art arrives online on April 21. With over 2,000 initial entries, peer-reviewed by some of the world&rsquo;s leading art historians and experts on South Asia, it is a project whose scope has not been tried before.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;If there is an encyclopedia of Indian art in Antarctica I don&rsquo;t know about it, but it&rsquo;s definitely not in India,&rdquo; said Abhishek Poddar, founder of the Museum of Art and Photography, or MAP, in Bangalore, which initiated the project. &ldquo;There was not a single comprehensive encyclopedia that existed, which is quite a shame.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe encyclopedia is broad in scope, in terms of both its content and those it hopes to reach. That audience includes not only collectors, both new and seasoned, but also academics, curators, students and anyone with a passing interest in learning about art from the region.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This encyclopedia really is pivotal,&rdquo; said Ayesha Bulchandani, a New York-based collector of Indian art who is both on MAP&rsquo;s advisory committee and a trustee of the Frick Collection. &ldquo;The digital presence of this encyclopedia really connects global cultures. It will inform libraries, curatorial staff, educational staff and the membership community because it just opens up dialogue across platforms.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMore on India\r\nManhunt in Punjab: The Indian authorities restricted communications across the state as they continued to search for a Sikh separatist leader whose rapid rise in the public eye has stirred fears of violence.\r\nIn Kashmir: The India government is reviving local militias in the Jammu part of the restive region, laying bare the limits of the country&rsquo;s military approach there.\r\n&lsquo;Giving Voice to the Voiceless&rsquo;: A journalist who belongs to a caste once deemed untouchable by India&rsquo;s hierarchical system is hoping to use her news outlet to improve the lives of the country&rsquo;s most marginalized people.\r\nUbiquitous QR Codes: India&rsquo;s homegrown instant payment system has remade commerce and pulled millions into the formal economy.\r\nIn many ways, the story of the encyclopedia is the story of the museum itself. Because of the pandemic, it did not have its planned physical opening two years ago, though its digital debut was quite a success.

Indian art history, he added, was &ldquo;not just kings and rulers but also local artisans&rdquo; and those who worked in community art.\r\n\r\nImage\r\n&ldquo;Indian Roller on Sandalwood Branch,&rdquo; (1779) by Sheikh Zain al-Din.\r\n&ldquo;Indian Roller on Sandalwood Branch,&rdquo; (1779) by Sheikh Zain al-Din.Credit...Gift of Elizabeth and Willard Clark\r\n\r\nTo write the encyclopedia, the academy hired over two dozen early career Indian academics and art historians to research and write the entries, which are then reviewed by international experts.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\n&ldquo;The MAP team had been using some of my books for reference and asked me if I could check their textile entries for accuracy,&rdquo; Rosemary Crill, a former senior curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, wrote in an email. &ldquo;In a confusing world of Wikipedia and other random bits of information, this could become the first point of inquiry for people wanting to know more about specific aspects of Indian art and culture.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGeopolitical boundaries have, of course, shifted over the centuries, so the encyclopedia embraces not only the art history of India but also that of the entire subcontinent.\r\n\r\nThe articles are specifically written in a straightforward and easy-to-understand style, something that has been lacking, said Anirudh V. Kanisetti, an editor of the encyclopedia and author of &ldquo;Lords of the Deccan: Southern India From the Chalukyas to the Cholas.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that South Asia needs more accessible history writing in the public domain,&rdquo; he wrote in an email. Compared with Britain or the United States, India&rsquo;s history, he wrote, tends to be &ldquo;much denser and more academic,&rdquo; noting that young people curious about their past &ldquo;need materials that bring out its complexity&rdquo; in an intelligent but relatable way.\r\n\r\nFor now, the encyclopedia will be in English, but ultimately it will be in regional languages as well. The project will also focus on translating historical texts from local languages into English for a wider audience to appreciate.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nDeepanjana Klein, Christie&rsquo;s international head for contemporary Indian &amp; Southeast Asian art, used as an example historical art from the state of Kerala that &ldquo;is so rich but a lot of the texts are in Malayali, which is not accessible to a lot of us.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMs. Klein added that the encyclopedia, which hopes to add about 1,500 entries a year, could become a critical resource for young collectors who want to learn more about how art developed across the subcontinent. &ldquo;The art market is very strong for South Asia and it is only getting bigger,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When people are spending $500,000 and above, one is also thinking, &lsquo;OK, what am I spending this on? I need to have a little more understanding of what I am getting involved with.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMs. Bulchandani agreed, saying that the encyclopedia will add to the &ldquo;connoisseurship and scholarship&rdquo; not only among more seasoned collectors but also for newer ones who have a different take on collecting.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I was talking about this project with younger collectors,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t go to libraries. They aren&rsquo;t buying books. They are not collecting stuff the way our generation did. Everything for them is digital.&rdquo; This encyclopedia, she said, &ldquo;is a groundbreaker.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n', '1679740141blog14.jpg', '2023-03-25 10:29:01', 5, 1, 0),
